# Introduction #
This document contains information needed to run the command line user interface.

# First Run #

To run the command line UI, download and extract the latest release. If you do not have Java installed on your machine, you have to download and install that as well.

On the command line, navigate to the `bin` folder inside the extracted folder and type: `dotify`. Press enter.

This will bring up a list of applications (or features):
  * [convert](Convert.md)
  * [emboss](Emboss.md)
  * [text2pef](TextToPef.md)
  * [pef2text](PefToText.md)
  * [validate](ValidatePef.md)
  * [split](SplitPef.md)
  * [merge](MergePef.md)
  * [generate](GeneratePef.md)
  * help

These are explained in detail in separate sections.
To start one of them, append their name as the first argument, for example:
`dotify convert`
