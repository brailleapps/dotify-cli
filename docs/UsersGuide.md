This document contains information needed to run the command line user interface.

# First Run #

To run the command line UI, download and extract the latest release. If you do not have Java installed on your machine, you have to download and install that as well.

On the command line, navigate to the `bin` folder inside the extracted folder and type: `dotify`. Press enter.

This will bring up a list of applications (or features). See the [Table of Contents](toc.md) for more information about each command.

To use one of these commands, append their name as the first argument, for example:

`dotify convert`
